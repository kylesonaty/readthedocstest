###How do you guys feel about using read the docs to host our webhooks documentation?

 * It is free. I think.
 * We don't have to host it. 
 * We just use github to check in the changes and it it builds the documents

```csharp
if (cool){
	return "Say something in Slack";
else
	return "Forever hold your peace. Just kidding say something in Slack too.";
```
